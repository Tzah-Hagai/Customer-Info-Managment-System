1. Move the files to a directory.
2. Run CMD and use cd to the directory location.
for example: 'cd C:\Users\tal\Desktop\Java_Projects\NightClub\Src'.
3. Complie the Src files: 'javac *.java'.
4. Run the program: 'java NightClubMgmtApp'.
5. Create a new customer of your choice. 
the next time you'll use the system, you will be able to search
for that customer's information.

side note: you will get an error saying 'file does not exist' for
the first time running the program.
